# SustainableShopper

This smartphone application is the result of my master thesis which focused on supporting its users in making sustainable choices
while preparing grocery lists. The Persuasive System Design model (PSD) by Oinas-Kukkonen & Harjumaa (2009)
is used as a framework to analyze 25 behavior change systems from the domains of sustainable food consumption, food 
consumption and eco-feedback applications for energy & water consumption. The PSD model is used to categorize the
system features in each of the 25 systems to identify usage trends of system features. It was found that the effects
of Normative Influence and Personal Goal-Setting were not studied very much in the context of sustainable food consumption.

A smartphone application was designed around these two novel system features, along with several other popular system features.
The system was prototyped and tested for usability, and then a high-fidelity prototype was developed for a field study with
11 participants. The participants answered two questionnaires, one before the field study and one afterwards; while a subset
of 8 participants were interviewed regarding their experiences with the application. A thematic analysis was conducted on the
interview transcripts, while a statistical analysis was conducted on the questionnaire responses. Due to the low number of
participants, the findings from the thematic analysis form the main findings of this work. Three main themes of motivation,
effort and community emerged from the thematic analysis. 

The findings from the field study highlight the uniqueness of users, how a one-size-fits-all approach to behavior change may
not prove most effective, and the complications of using Normative Influence and personal goal setting features to support behavior
change. It also highlights the importance of Personalization and Tailoring in behavior change systems, reducing effort for and
supporting agency in behavior change, and the individuality of motivation.
