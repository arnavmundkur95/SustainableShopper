# SustainableShopper

This smartphone application is the result of my master thesis which focused on supporting its users in making sustainable choices
while preparing grocery lists. The Persuasive System Design model (PSD) by Oinas-Kukkonen & Harjumaa (2009)
was used as a framework to analyze 25 behavior change systems from the domains of sustainable food consumption, food 
consumption and eco-feedback applications for energy & water consumption. The PSD model was used to categorize the
system features in each of the 25 systems to identify usage trends of system features. It was found that the effects
of Normative Influence and Personal Goal-Setting were not studied very much in the context of sustainable food consumption.

A smartphone application was designed around these two novel system features, along with several other popular system features.
The application allows users to plan grocery lists by adding products from various dutch supermarkets. The application uses 
term matching to suggest sustainable alternatives to conventional meat and dairy products, and allows the user to set themselves
goals to reduce the number of animal products they consume.
